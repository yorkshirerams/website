# Summary

Based at Leeds Beckett University, Headingley Campus and playing games out of John Charles Centre for Sport (south Leeds), the Rams have been representing Yorkshire in kitted American Football for over 30 years. During that time they have established themselves as one of the leading forces in British Football in the North of England.

The Rams played in Britain’s second tier until 2012 when they were promoted to the BAFANL Premiership North where they now compete with long-standing rivals Doncaster Mustangs, and Glasgow’s East Kilbride Pirates.

The club joined forces with the Leeds Academy of American Football in 2018 to form the new **Yorkshire Academy of American Football** and subsequently changed their name to the **Yorkshire Academy Rams** to strengthen the link. Another major change saw the clubs main black and gold colours switched for black and purple, to match the colours of the new academy.

# More of the history

The club was founded in 1986 as the Wakefield Wasps and moved to Huddersfield in 1987 and was based at the Rugby union football club ground, in the Waterloo area. Shortly after they moved to the Fartown Rugby league ground. The club were originally called **Huddersfield Rams**.

In 1990 the club again moved home to the Leeds road Hockey pitch, in Huddersfield. This venue was short lived as 1991 saw a major reorganisation of the club, both to a new and more permanent home at the Dalton based Amateur rugby league football club ground in Moldgreen, also in Huddersfield. In view of the increase of the size of the club’s recruiting area this reorganisation also saw the change of the club’s name to the **Yorkshire Rams**.

In 1996 the club moved to more luxurious conditions at the Lawrence Batley Sports Centre at Salendine Nook in Huddersfield. The following year they moved both venue and home town to the Walton Sports & Social club in Wakefield, The following year due to Health and safety rules the club again moved home to the Westgate Redoubt ARLFC, in Wakefield.

After a good season and some sponsorship, in 2004, the Rams found themselves moving to the **Rams Stadium**, home of the Dewsbury Rams in Kirklees. The club ground was renamed in 2005 to the **Tetley Stadium**. Again the following year, 2006, saw another move of club venue to the Milnthorpe Green home of **Sandal RUFC** in Wakefield.
