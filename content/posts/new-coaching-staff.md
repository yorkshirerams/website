Yorkshire Academy Rams head coach Dale Bottomley has named the senior members of his new coaching staff.

Dale was appointed last month as the successor to former Rams head coach David Pawson, and has wasted little time putting plans in place for the club’s future as part of the Yorkshire Academy of American Football.

As off-season preparations continue, Dale has now been joined by a host of familiar faces in his backroom staff.

Dale himself will also serve as offensive co-ordinator, assisted by new quarterbacks coach Jason Shaw who has previously worked with Dale at university team Leeds Beckett Carnegie.

Dale’s own focus will be on the offensive line with Kayleigh Whybrow as an assistant positional coach. Kayleigh, the wife of Rams receiver Spencer Whybrow and a player for the Carnegie Chargers women’s team, has worked with the team in the past and is one of a number of the new staff providing continuity from previous seasons.

Another is wide receivers coach Mark Gaze, a former Rams player who continues in last season’s role. Two more ex-Rams, Steve Smith and Spencer Hind, will work with the running backs.

On defence, Christian Thompson comes in as defensive co-ordinator having previously worked with the Carnegie Chargers as well as NFC2 side the Crewe Railroaders. He was also part of the coaching staff with the Great Britain women’s team at last year’s World Championship in Canada.

Christian will serve as lead coach for the team’s defensive backs, with a couple more familiar faces working at the other levels of the defence.

Adam Cowley needs no introduction, as a long-time Rams player and last year joint defensive co-ordinator, and will now work with the defensive line. Heading up the linebacker coaching is Jacob Barner, who established himself as an impact player early last season before injuries forced him to call time on his playing days.

Last but certainly not least, Nick Riding joins the team as strength and conditioning co-ordinator. Nick, another member of Dale’s staff at Carnegie, was introduced to players alongside Dale at a recent team meeting and has already begun working on off-season conditioning programmes.

Assistant coaching positions are still open to applications – interested parties should contact Dale Bottomley at d.bottomley@leedsbeckett.ac.uk
